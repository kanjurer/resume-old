  aboutMe:
    'I am Kanav, currently an undergraduate CS student. And as a student, I seek for knowledge, and practical experience of everything that I put my hands on. My curiosity and excitement lie in the enormous possibilities that technology has brought and I am happy to be a part of such a dynamic and versatile field. My current interests are in freelancing, though I am completely open to working with people - flourishing with everyone and building connections. Work aside, I play guitar too. Also, from past couple of years I have been walking on the path of self development and enhancing myself daily.  :D ',

          review: `Kanav Bhardwaj has been doing a marvelous job volunteering with my team and I on a project over the past few months. It is a website to help connect users with resources and people to complete their projects & goals. Kanav has been leading the website team and he is a real treasure to work with. He is passionate, intelligent, and self-motivated. He also communicates clearly and thoroughly. He has patience & understanding with team members who arenâ€™t as tech savvy, and has no problem teaching people on the team valuable website building & maintenance skills.


          I have worked with many people on many projects, and have found Kanav to be one of the best among them. He is easy to work with and always a pleasure to see and hear from.
          
          I would strongly recommend him for any endeavor he wishes to pursue, because I know he is going to soar high in anything he does; plus he would be a valuable asset to any company or school.`,
